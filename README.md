Monitoring Dashboard for the Tesla Powerwall using Grafana, InfluxDB and Telegraf.

## NEW LOCATION

**This fork has materially changed from the original and is now hosted in a new location.**

This is based on the great work by [mihailescu2m](https://github.com/mihailescu2m/powerwall_monitor) but has been modified to use pypowerwall as a proxy to the Powerwall and includes solar String graphs for Powerwall+ systems.

## Requirements

The host system will require:

* docker
* docker-compose

## Setup

Clone this repo to your local host that will run the dashboard:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jasonacox/powerwall_monitor.git
```

## Quick Start

Run the interactive setup script that will ask you for your Powerwall details and Time Zone data.

```bash
    ./setup.sh
```

Jump to the **Grafana Setup** below to complete the setup.

## Manual Install

If you prefer, you can perform the same steps that `setup.sh` performs.

You will want to set your local timezone by editing `powerwall.yml`, `influxdb.sql` and `dashboard.json` or you can use this handy `tz.sh` update script.  A list of timezones is available [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

```bash
  # Replace with your timezone
  bash tz.sh "America/Los_Angeles"
```

### Docker Containers

* Edit `powerwall.yml` and look for the section under `pypowerall` and update the following details for your Powerwall:

```yml
            PW_PASSWORD: "password"
            PW_EMAIL: "email@example.com"
            PW_HOST: "192.168.91.1"
            PW_TIMEZONE: "America/Los_Angeles"
            PW_DEBUG: "yes"

```

* Start the docker containers

```bash
    docker-compose -f powerwall.yml up -d
```

### InfluxDB

* Connect to the Influx database to import setup commands: 

```bash
    docker exec -it influxdb influx -import -path=/var/lib/influxdb/influxdb.sql
```

Note: the influxdb.sql file is set to use `America/Los_Angeles` as timezone. Use the `tz.sh` script or manually update the database commands above to replace `America/Los_Angeles` with your own timezone.

## Grafana Setup

* Open up Grafana in a browser at `http://<server ip>:9000` and login with `admin/admin`

* From `Configuration\Data Sources` add `InfluxDB` database with:
  - Name: `InfluxDB`
  - URL: `http://influxdb:8086`
  - Database: `powerwall`
  - Min time interval: `5s`
  - Click "Save & test" button

* From `Configuration\Data Sources` add `Sun and Moon` database with:
  - Name: `Sun and Moon`
  - Enter your latitude and longitude. You can use this [web page](https://jasonacox.github.io/powerwall_monitor/location.html) to find your GPS location if you don't know).
  - Click "Save & test" button

* From `Dashboard\Manage` (or `Dashboard\Browse`), select `Import`, and upload `dashboard.json`

### Notes

* The database queries and dashboard are set to use `America/Los_Angeles` as the timezone. Remember to edit the database commands [influxdb.sql](influxdb/influxdb.sql), [powerwall.yml](powerwall.yml), and [dashboard.json](dashboard.json) to replace `America/Los_Angeles` with your own timezone.

* InfluxDB does not run reliably on older models of Raspberry Pi, resulting in the Docker container terminating with `error 139`.  

### Troubleshooting Tips

Check the logs of the services using:

```bash
    docker logs -f pypowerwall
    docker logs -f telegraf
    docker logs -f influxdb
    docker logs -f grafana
```
